These payloads are intended to aid in security research, penetration testing, and educational purposes, helping individuals understand and test for XSS vulnerabilities in web applications.

In addition to the other payloads, the xss-priv-payloads.txt file includes payloads specifically designed for WAF bypass techniques.
